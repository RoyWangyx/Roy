  abstract = {"This is the second edition of the now definitive text on partial differential equations (PDE). It offers a comprehensive survey of modern techniques in the theoretical study of PDE with particular emphasis on nonlinear equations. Its wide scope and clear exposition make it a great text for a graduate course in PDE. For this edition, the author has made numerous changes, including: a new chapter on nonlinear wave equations, more than 80 new exercises, several new sections, and a significantly expanded bibliography."--Publisher's description.},
